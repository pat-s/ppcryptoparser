# ppcryptoparser 0.1.0

- The separator for CSV outputs is now fixed to "semicolon" as this seems to be the global PP default across all languages.
- New argument `dec` to allow setting a custom decimal separator. This is helpful if the decimal separator does not follow the PP language setting.
- Allow setting `pp_security_name` for `parse_cardano()`.


# ppcryptoparser 0.0.1
